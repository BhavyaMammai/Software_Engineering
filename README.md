SIX Project Documentation
This repository contains the full documentation for the SIX Project. The project involves developing an advanced streaming device to bring streaming content from popular platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime directly to traditional TVs. The SIX device, connected via HDMI and Wi-Fi, allows users to access streaming services, manage accounts, and control the device through a remote or a web interface.

# Overview
The SIX Project aims to improve accessibility and user experience for streaming content on standard TVs. The project was conceptualized to integrate with various streaming providers, offering a seamless experience through a dedicated device. Our main objective was to outline a strategic approach for developing and launching the device in a competitive streaming market, with a target launch in Japan.

# Key Features (Conceptual)
- HDMI-compatible streaming device for traditional TVs
- User-friendly interface for content browsing and streaming
- Integration with IMDb for detailed content information
- Subscription management, including sign-ups and cancellations
- Custom remote control for easy playback and navigation
# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
This repository documents a detailed SDLC approach as if developing the SIX Project within a real-world organization. The project was not actually developed, but a comprehensive plan was created to simulate the SDLC phases.

- Requirements Gathering: Defined functional and non-functional requirements based on user and market needs.
- Design: Created system diagrams (context, frame, entity relationship, and data flow diagrams) to illustrate the conceptual system interactions.
- Development Planning: Mapped out the core features such as account management, streaming integration, and remote control functionality.
- Testing Strategy: Outlined a comprehensive testing plan covering unit, integration, and system tests to validate requirements.
- Deployment Strategy: Proposed deployment strategies and system-level test plans to ensure a smooth market introduction in the targeted region.
# Repository Contents
This repository includes:

- SDLC Documentation: A conceptual breakdown of all SDLC phases, including problem definition, requirements, design, testing, and deployment planning.
- Diagrams: Detailed system diagrams illustrating how the system is intended to function.
- Requirements Traceability: Conceptual mapping of requirements to test cases, ensuring full coverage in a hypothetical implementation.
- Test Plan: System-level test plan covering functional and non-functional requirements for the envisioned system.
# How to Use This Repository
- Explore the Documentation: Review each document to understand the planning and design phases we would follow for a real-world implementation.
- Use Case Reference: Check the Use Case and Diagrams sections for conceptual user interaction flows and system functionality.
- Testing Strategy: Examine the proposed test plan and quality metrics, which outline a hypothetical testing process and performance criteria.
